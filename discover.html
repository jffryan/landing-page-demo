        I had looked, not without joy, at that long kaleidoscope of coloured
        lights arranged in large letters and sprawling trade-marks, advertising
        everything, from pork to pianos, through the agency of the two most
        vivid and most mystical of the gifts of God; colour and fire. I said to
        them, in my simplicity, 'What a glorious garden of wonders this would
        be, to any one who was lucky enough to be unable to read.'

        Modern pizza developed in Naples, when tomato was added to the focaccia
        in the late 18th century. However, pizza was mainly eaten in the country
        of Italy and by immigrants from there. This changed after World War II,
        when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with
        other Italian foods.

      <h2>Make an Italian pizza</h2>

      <p>(makes dough for 4 pizzas, each one about 12 inches in diameter)</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>600 mL of warm water</li>
        <li>7 cups (1kg) flour</li>
        <li>
          2.5 – 3 tablespoons (25 grams) of fresh yeast or 2 teaspoons (7-8
          grams) of dried yeast
        </li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
      </ul>

      />

      <h3>Method</h3>

      <p>
        Sprinkle the yeast into a medium bowl with the warm water. We don’t mean
        hot, and we don’t mean cold… we mean warm! That’s the kind the yeast
        likes best. Stir until the yeast dissolves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Place almost all of the flour on the table in the shape of a volcano.
        (Think Mt. Vesuvius… appropriate since Naples is the king of all pizza
        cities!).
      </p>

      <p>
        Pour the yeast-and-warm-water mix, along with the other ingredients,
        into the “crater” of the volcano.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knead everything together for 10 to 15 minutes until the dough is smooth
        and elastic, keeping your surface floured.
      </p>

        src="imgs/discover/timesquare.jpg"
        class="inline-photo show-on-scroll"
        alt="Time Square at sunset"
      />

      <p>
        Grease up a bowl with some olive oil and put the dough inside. Turn the
        dough around so the top is slightly oiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cover the bowl and put the dough aside to let it rest for at least four
        or five hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        (optional for those who want their pizza really authentic). Make a cross
        on top of the dough with a knife. An old Italian tradition, this is seen
        as a way of “blessing the bread.”
      </p>

      <p>Preheat the oven to about 400°F, or about 200°C.</p>

      <p>
        Dump the dough out of the bowl and back onto the floured surface. Punch
        it down, getting rid of any bubbles. (Note: Now’s the time to enlist a
        kid with more energy than they know what to do with!).
      </p>

      <p>Divide the dough in half and let it rest for a few minutes.</p>

      <p>
        Roll each section into a 12-inch disc. Now’s your chance to decide how
        thick you want your pizza to be! Do you want it pizza alta
        (Neapolitan-style) or pizza bassa (Roman-style)? Just remember, your
        crust will puff up a little bit as it’s baked!
      </p>

        src="imgs/discover/bridge.jpg"
        class="inline-photo show-on-scroll"

      />

      <p>Transfer the dough onto an oiled pizza pan or baking sheet.</p>

      <p>
        Add tomato sauce, if you want a pizza rossa (red pizza). Lots of pizzas
        in Italy are actually pizza bianca, without tomato sauce, so don’t feel
        like you have to! Brush the edges of the crust with a little bit of
        olive oil.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bake each pizza for about 10 minutes, then add mozzarella cheese (sliced
        or grated) on top, as well as any other ingredients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let the pizzas bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted.
        By lifting up the pizza to peek underneath, you can make sure the bottom
        has browned, too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remove your pizzas from the oven and, for a real Italian touch, garnish
        with a few basil leaves. And enjoy!
      </p>
